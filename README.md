## **Project Focus and Updates from the Mid-Term Presentation**
Our project has undergone significant development since the mid-term presentation:  

1. **Expanded Analysis:**  
   - **Service Impact Assessment** and **Participant Demographics** integrated with **Housing Stability** and **Resource Allocation** analysis across YSM programs.  
   - Examined interactions between these critical domains of social service delivery.  

2. **Model Enhancement:**  
   - Incorporated all recommendations and rectifications suggested by Prof. Dr. Jay Qi, PhD and YSM program stakeholders.  
   - Developed sophisticated predictive models with 98% accuracy for participant success forecasting.  
   - Enhanced data integration methodology addressing missing data challenges through hierarchical imputation strategies.  
   - Built comprehensive analysis using machine learning principles, creating evidence-based recommendations for program optimization.
